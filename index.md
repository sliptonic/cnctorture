## What's This

This site contains a catalog of test files specifically designed to test CAM applications.
The files are organized and tagged to make finding them easy.

Standard test files are useful for:

* Developing new applications and features
* Testing features and comparing performance
* Demonstrating and reporting bugs

This collection is a work-in-progress.  Contributions and improvements are always welcome.
The site is generated from a Github repo at:
