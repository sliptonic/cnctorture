Pockets that have one or more open boundary walls represent a special challenge for pocketing operations. The tool is free to move beyond the edge in these cases and failure to do so will leave behind material that could otherwise be removed safely. A proper pocketing operation will identify the open boundary and create tool paths that extend beyond the edge to clear the remaining material.
